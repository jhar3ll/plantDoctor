# plantDoctor

Plant Doctor is a single-page mobile application that helps you to keep track of your home plants and their watering needs. Create an account and add at least
one plant to begin. After giving your plant a name and a watering frequency, you can check off your daily waterings as you complete them. Each check corresponds to a 
count of your completed waterings, and is updated in a real online database in real time. 

Users can tap on the plant icons to update or delete a plant. Users can also see the watering history for each one of their plants of up to 3 previous days. If a user 
updates the plant name or water frequency, the results are updated to the database and the client profile in real-time. Users are also reminded via push notifications 
if plants have not been watered after a certain time-period.

Use Plant Doctor today and never forget to water your plants again!
